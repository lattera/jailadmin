jailadmin helps manually bring online FreeBSD jails that are configured
to use a vnet interface and a bridge. Additional types of jails might
be supported later on.

Prerequisites

* PHP installed in /usr/local
* MySQL Server

Initial Setup
=============
1) Initialize flourishlib:
        git submodule init && git submodule update

2) Copy db.php.default to db.php:
        cp db.php.default db.php

3) Edit db.php with your db settings

4) Install the db schema:
    mysql [username/password/db] < schema.sql

Using jailadmin

jailadmin only supports an interactive interface right now.
